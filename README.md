LightsOnReminder
================

     Have you ever woke up early in the morning to find out that the kids (or adults) in your home forgot to turn off the lights? I've had that happen a number of times in my kitchen, which has 5 lights built in. A lot of wasted electricity.
     My project will monitor lights in any room between 10 pm and 5 am. This of course can easily be changed in software. The first time lights are sensed, a short beep will occur. Then a grace period of 30 minutes or 1 hour  will take place. No alarm during this grace time.  This will be selectable with a switch. The grace period is for the midnight snackers or the person who can't sleep and goes to watch a little TV. Not enough grace time? Press a switch to reset the grace period.
     If the person walks away without turning off the lights, then after the grace period, an alarm will sound off to remind someone to turn the lights off. If lights are off, then the device will simply go back being a clock and continue to monitor until 5 am.
     This project will teach you about working with Arduino Uno, LCD display, real time clocks (RTC), piezo buzzers, and photocell sensors.
